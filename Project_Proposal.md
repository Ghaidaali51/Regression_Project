<h1> Predict Cars Prices Project  </h1>

<br>


<h3> Introduction</h3> 
 <p>on my project side, I will be working with cars prices prediction so that depends on dataset features. <br>
<b> " price prediction depends on features " </b>, so that will detect the independent features to prediction the price  
in this project, I will be using the scraping techniques with ML as Linear Regression <br>
  For that I using the two sites to help me to scraping the data from global sites.
</p>
<br> 


<h3> Data</h3> 
<p>To scraping the data from global sites we need to detect and know what website we need to scraped, Also determine what data division we need to save in our dataset, So that
Collected the features data and target <br>
I used beautifulSoup in python Library for pulling data out of HTML to scrape the site <br>
In my project side I used the two global sites for scraped : <br>
 
The first site is Car.com <br>
- https://www.cars.com/ <br>
cars site it's globally site to show all cars types with all features like:  Fuel type, car year, price,Kms Driven and like this features <br>

The second site is kijiAuto.com <br>
- https://www.kijijiautos.ca/<br>
kiji auto site it's globally site to show all used and new cars , 
that is have more of features like :  Drivetrain , Transmission and like this features </p>

<b>NOTE : <br>
Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs. Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration.
<br> 
I used Postman for checked if the API is valid and sucess or not </b>
