<ul>
<li><h4> In the car price prediction project, I used a heat map to display all correlations between features and a target,
I found a correlation between the 'year' feature and the 'price' feature, and I explained this relationship as a scatter plot 
  in the sea so that it aims to discover this correlation because it helps to predict a model as accurately. </h4></li><br>
<li> <h4> My goal in the car price prediction project is to find the high accuracy model that help me to predict target with features for that I used
  <ins>Random Forest Regressor</ins> in car price prediction project  , which aims to the estimator that fits a number of classifying decision trees on various sub-samples 
  of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.  </h4></li>
</ul>
